# Localization

## Clustering 

## Bias Variance tradeoff

## Cooperative
  * los
  * nlos
  * the data is generated normally, i.e., I specify 1/2 BSs as NLOS, the rest as LOS 
  * list down parameters 
  * MSE error
  * Which SDP ?

## Cooperative_1
  * los
  * nlos
  * the data is generated using the Poisson process
  * coop data clustering 
  * SDP - cooperative, multiple user 

## Coopertive_2
  * non-coop, but multiple users together 

## Cooperative_3 
  * perform localization on clustered data 

## Iterative 
  * generate data 
  * do a non-coop multiple user localization 
  * use this preliminary information to perform cooperative localization 
  * sdp_3_coop.m : function
  * sdp_3_cooperative.m : normal .m file 

## localization_1
  * The folder that I am using for organization

## los_nlos
  * data generation + clustering + gen things 

## loss_surface
  * for plotting the loss surface of MLE objective 

## paper_loc
  * to reproduce results in the paper

## non-cooperative 
  * los_non_coop
  * all the recent work 
  * including loss surfaces
